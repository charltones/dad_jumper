# dad_jumper

Beginnings of a simple platform game in pygame zero. Use left and right arrow to move with up arrow to jump.

The game has a built in (crude) editor. To enter edit mode just press E. You can drag and drop any of the objects in the game. If you press D it will delete the object under the mouse. If you press G it will place a new ground block where your mouse is. Note the collision detection can be problematic if the blocks aren't exactly lined up.

To start the game just type `pgzrun main.py`.
